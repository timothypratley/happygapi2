# HappyGAPI2

A Clojure library for calling [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer); gsheets, drive, bigquery, and so on.

This project is the successor to [HappyGAPI (deprecated)](https://github.com/timothypratley/happygapi),
the oauth2 and generation were moved to [HappyAPI](https://github.com/timothypratley/happyapi).
The new artifact name `io.github.timothypratley/happygapi2` was introduced to avoid breaking changes.

## Rationale

HappyGAPI2 is a bunch of generated functions (as code, not macros) for calling GAPI,
so that your editor can help you (autocomplete, help documentation, and arg checking).

1. Navigate to source
2. See all available resources and methods
3. Clear exception stack traces on failure
4. The function doc-strings contain a description, a link to online docs, and example inputs
5. Needs to be regenerated to discovery API updates

## Usage

Add the dependency to the project file:

![clojars version](https://clojars.org/happygapi2/latest-version.svg)

Require `happygapi.<<api>>` in the code:

```clojure
(ns my.ns
  (:require [happygapi.sheets :as sheets]))

(sheets/spreadsheets-get "SPREADSHEET-ID")
```

### Authorization

To create an app in the Google Console, follow [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849?hl=en).
When setting up the app credentials, add http://localhost/redirect to the authorized redirect URIs, and add yourself as a test user.

There are two methods for obtaining a token:
* User redirects, which prompt a user to authorize your app.
  Download the `secret.json` from the [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  Do not add this file to source control, keep it secured.
  This method is suitable if you want users to grant your app access to their data.
* Service account private key (suitable for server to server).
  [Create a Service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account)
  and download a `service.json` key file.
  Do not add this file to source control, keep it secured.
  This method is suitable for automated jobs.

The [`happy.oauth2-credentials`](src/happy/oauth2_credentials.clj) namespace provides a convenient way to
manage authorization.
By default, it tries to read `secret.json` or `service.json` from disk in the current directory.
You can pass in configuration map of the same shape instead.
`happy.oauth2-credentials` stores tokens on disk.
If you want to use HappyGAPI in a web app, you should instead store and fetch tokens from your database.
This can be done by calling `init!` with a `fetch` and `store` function, or by creating your own implementation of `auth!`.

The [`happy.oauth2-capture-redirect`](src/happy/oauth2_capture_redirect.clj)
namespace provides a listener to capture a code when the user is redirected to your site from the oauth2 provider.
If you use it, you will need to include [ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) as a dependency.
Web applications should instead define a route to capture the code.

The [`happy.oauth2`](src/happy/oauth2.clj) namespace provides generic functions to support oauth2 authorization so that you can assemble only the parts you need.
